ADMVP PROJECT WRAP-UP

Initial buildout of an ad prototype for Roscoe.TV is now done. In server's /testbed directory, we now have a mock-up version of the site with ad display features.

A rundown of how we performed on all the requirements laid out at the beginning of this project. As in previous projects, original requirement is copied below verbatim, with final status in parentheses afterward. 

•Be built in HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery 2.0. (SUCCESS)

•Employ Google Analytics to track ad views and ad click-throughs for one site sponsor per week. (SUCCESS.)

•Display an interstitial full-page ad upon initial site visit by a visitor to any page. (SUCCESS)

•Display a clickable ad/sponsor message on playback pages for individual news stories. (SUCCESS)

•Include a separate MailChimp account to send HTML messages. (REMOVED FROM SCOPE. This was a personal preference of mine, but as the project was driving on and it wasn't requested by other team members, I decided to skip for now.)

Known issues: None.

Code from this project should be ready to deploy quickly once we close sale of an actual ad. Just to be safe, it's recommended that when the time comes, we begin moving code over 48-72 hours **before** first sponsor's ad is due to begin displaying. That will leave ample time to do any last-minute troubleshooting, even if sponsor gets a small amount of "freebie" display time. -pm
